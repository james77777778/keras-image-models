# Keras Image Models

## Description

**K**eras **Im**age **M**odels (`kimm`) is a collection of image models, blocks and layers written in Keras 3. The goal is to offer SOTA models with pretrained weights in a user-friendly manner.

## Installation

```bash
# In a working [jax/tensorflow/torch/numpy] backend environment
pip install keras kimm
```

## Quickstart

### Use Pretrained Model

```python
from keras import random

import kimm

# Use `kimm.list_models` to get the list of available models
print(kimm.list_models())

# Specify the name and other arguments to filter the result
print(kimm.list_models("efficientnet", weights="imagenet"))  # fuzzy search

# Initialize the model with pretrained weights
model = kimm.models.EfficientNetV2B0(weights="imagenet")

# Predict
x = random.uniform([1, 192, 192, 3]) * 255.0
y = model.predict(x)
print(y.shape)

# Initialize the model as a feature extractor with pretrained weights
model = kimm.models.EfficientNetV2B0(
    feature_extractor=True, weights="imagenet"
)

# Extract features for downstream tasks
y = model.predict(x)
print(y.keys())
print(y["BLOCK5_S32"].shape)
```

### Transfer Learning

```python
from keras import layers
from keras import models
from keras import random

import kimm

# Initialize the model as a backbone with pretrained weights
backbone = kimm.models.EfficientNetV2B0(
    input_shape=[224, 224, 3],
    include_top=False,
    pooling="avg",
    weights="imagenet",
)

# Freeze the backbone for transfer learning
backbone.trainable = False

# Construct the model with new head
inputs = layers.Input([224, 224, 3])
x = backbone(inputs, training=False)
x = layers.Dropout(0.2)(x)
outputs = layers.Dense(2)(x)
model = models.Model(inputs, outputs)

# Train the new model (put your own logic here)

# Predict
x = random.uniform([1, 224, 224, 3]) * 255.0
y = model.predict(x)
print(y.shape)
```
